# REAL-ESTATE-PRICE-PREDICTION

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting real estate prices using machine learning techniques. The model has been trained on historical housing data to provide accurate price estimations.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various features such as:
- **Location**
- **Area Type**
- **Total Square Feet**
- **Number of Bedrooms & Bathrooms**
- **Availability Status**

## Data Preprocessing
- **Handled missing values**
- **Removed outliers** to improve model accuracy
- **Feature engineering** to enhance predictive power

## Model Performance
- The best-performing model achieved an **RÂ² score of 0.86**.
- Feature importance analysis indicates that **location, area type, and total square feet** play a significant role in determining house prices.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate **economic indicators** and **amenities** for better accuracy
- Experiment with **ensemble models** and **deep learning techniques**

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
